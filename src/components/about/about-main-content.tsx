              <p className="mt-6 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Born from a desire to merge cutting-edge technology with everyday wellness, HydroChill started as a simple idea: what if your water bottle could do more? Our founders, a team of passionate engineers, designers, and health advocates, were tired of single-use plastics and questionably clean reusable bottles. They envisioned a product that not only kept water cold but also purified it on the go, creating a truly seamless and worry-free hydration experience. After years of relentless research, prototyping, and user testing in the most demanding environments, the HydroChill smart bottle was bornâ€”a testament to our commitment to innovation and quality.
